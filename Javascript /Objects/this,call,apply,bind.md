# JavaScript Advanced Functions: Context and Explicit Setting

## Learning Goals

* Explicitly override context with `call` and `apply`
* Explicitly lock context for a function with `bind`

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we learned that when we invoke functions JavaScript
will make a context available inside the function. That context will be set to
"whatever's to the left of the dot" or, when there's nothing to the left of the dot, the global object.

JavaScript provides other means for specifying what _we_ want the context to
be. These are the _explicit_ methods of setting execution context: `call`,
`apply`, and `bind`.

## Explicitly Override Context with `call` and `apply`

The methods on functions called `call` and `apply` allow us to override the
_execution context_.

Let's think back to a previous lesson and recall working with records. We'll
invoke the functions in a familiar way, but also show how we could achieve the
equivalent behavior using `call` or `apply`.

```js
let asgardianBrothers = [
  {
    firstName: "Thor",
    familyName: "Odinsson"
  },
  {
    firstName: "Loki",
    familyName: "Laufeysson-Odinsson"
  }
]

function intro(person, line) {
  return `${person.firstName} ${person.familyName} says: ${line}`
}

function introWithContext(line){
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.familyName} says: ${line}`
}

let phrase = "I like this brown drink very much, bring me another!"
intro(asgardianBrothers[0], phrase) //=> Thor Odinsson says: I like this brown drink very much, bring me another!
intro(asgardianBrothers[0], phrase) === introWithContext.call(asgardianBrothers[0], phrase) //=> true
intro(asgardianBrothers[0], phrase) === introWithContext.apply(asgardianBrothers[0], [phrase]) //=> true

let complaint = "I was falling for thirty minutes!"
intro(asgardianBrothers[1], complaint) === introWithContext.call(asgardianBrothers[1], complaint) //=> true
intro(asgardianBrothers[1], complaint) === introWithContext.apply(asgardianBrothers[1], [complaint]) //=> true
```

When we first wrote a record-oriented program, we wrote functions in the style
of `intro`. They took the record *as an argument*. In fact, if we look at the
`solution` branch for the previous lesson, we'll see that multiple functions
have the same first parameter: `employee`, the record. Your solution probably
has a similar repetition.

```js
function createTimeInEvent(employee, dateStamp){ /* */ }
function createTimeOutEvent(employee, dateStamp){ /* */ }
function hoursWorkedOnDate(employee, soughtDate){ /* */ }
```

What if we told JavaScript that instead of the record being a _parameter_ (in
addition to a phrase), it could be assumed as a _context_ and thus accessible
via `this`. That's what we're doing with the function `introWithContext` as
invoked with either `call` or `apply`.

The `introWithContext` function expects only a catchphrase as an argument. Both `call` and
`apply` take a `thisArg` argument as their first argument (see their
documentation for further clarification): that argument becomes the `this`
_inside_ the function.  In the case of `call`, anything after the `thisArg`
gets passed to the function like arguments inside of a `()`. In the case of
`apply`, the contents in the `Array` get destructured and passed to the
function like arguments inside of a `()`.

> **ES6 ALERT**: Some might wonder: if we have destructuring of `Array`s, why
> do we need both `call` _and_ `apply` since a destructured `Array`, as
> required by `apply` could simply be destructured and fed to `call`.
> Destructuring is a relatively new arrival to JavaScript, so before then
> JavaScript had two separate methods.

## Explicitly Lock Context For a Function With `bind`

Let's suppose that we wanted to create the `introWithContext` function, but
have it permanently bound to `asgardianBrothers[0]`. As the adjective "bound"
suggests, we use `bind`:

```js
let asgardianBrothers = [
  {
    firstName: "Thor",
    familyName: "Odinsson"
  },
  {
    firstName: "Loki",
    familyName: "Laufeysson-Odinsson"
  }
]
function introWithContext(line){
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.familyName} says: ${line}`
}

let thorIntro = introWithContext.bind(asgardianBrothers[0])
thorIntro("Hi, Jane") //=> Thor Odinsson says: Hi, Jane
thorIntro("I love snakes") //=> Thor Odinsson says: I love snakes
```

The `bind` method ***returns a function that needs to be called***, but
wherever the function that `bind` was called on had a `this` reference, the
`this` is "hard set" to what was passed into `bind`.

## Conclusion

To sum up the explicit overrides:

1. Execution context is set in a function by invoking `call` on the function
   and passing, as the first argument, a `thisArg` which is accessed via `this`
   in the function. Additional parameters to the function are listed after `,`
2. Execution context is set in a function by invoking `apply` on the function
   and passing, as first argument, a `thisArg` which is accessed via `this` in
   the function. Additional parameters to the function are stored in the
   second argument: an `Array` containing arguments to the function.
3. Execution context can be locked in a function by invoking `bind` on it and
   passing it a `thisArg`. The `bind` function makes a copy of the
   functionality of its function but with all the `this` stuff locked in place
   and returns that function. That _new_ function can have arguments passed to it
   during its call with `()` as usual.
